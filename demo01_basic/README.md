the code are also available in [Plunker](http://plnkr.co/edit/WFjgtT?p=preview) or [Github](https://github.com/ShelmyLin/ng-table_demos/tree/master/demo01_basic). And I have encountered a small && stupid problem, which was shown in [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38094991/cant-load-an-array-to-ngtable/38095353#38095353)

- "Your error is you call createTable function before you set initpageSize so initParams.counts is undefined"
